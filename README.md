# vsAngular2

This is a aspnet core project integration with angular2. It meant to get developer started with project without too much configuration work. 


You need to run gulp restore -> to generated javascripts files in libs folder. essentially you should only do this once. 

I copy exactly from Angular2 quickstart project and the following files are exactly the same package.json, tsconfig, system.config.js. 

To run this, you just need to press F5 and browse to http://localhost:<your port>/index.html

Good luck!
